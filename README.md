# Totally Tubular 80's Tunes Trivia

https://andrewsrea.github.io/TriviaGame/

A multiple choice trivia game which asks a player to match an 80's song to that song's artist or band.

Only one multiple choice shows up at a time with a timer for each question, and the player must answer before the timer runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will congratulate them for choosing the right option. 
After a few seconds, the next multiple choice will appear on the screen with the same timer.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and unanswered multiple choices. Wrong answers will display an incorrect choice.

On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions will be displayed.
And the player will have the option to restart the game.

Have a totally radical time!
